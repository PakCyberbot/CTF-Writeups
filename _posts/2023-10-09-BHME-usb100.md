For a challenge file, I had a Wireshark capture (pcapng) of USB traffic. First, I used the following command to dump the raw USB data transferred between devices:
```bash
tshark -r send.pcapng  -2 -e "usb.capdata"  -Tfields > dump.txt  
```
After obtaining all the data, I converted it from hex data. I then proceeded to separate each file. I uploaded dump.txt to CyberChef and applied the "from hex" recipe, downloading the result as download.dat.

Next, I used binwalk to extract all the files from download.dat:

```bash
binwalk --dd=".*" download.dat
```

Most of the extracted files were anime images, along with 2 unknown files and a Windows executable file.

I utilized Wine to run the executable and easily obtained the flag!
